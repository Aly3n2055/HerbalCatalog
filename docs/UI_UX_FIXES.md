### Card Payment Flow:

2. Fills in card details with real-time validation
3. Clicks "Pay $X.XX" button
4. Frontend sends request to `/paypal/card-payment`
5. Server processes payment and returns result
6. Success: Shows success toast, clears cart after 2 seconds
7. Error: Shows error toast with specific message

### PayPal Payment Flow:
1. User selects "PayPal" tab
2. Clicks PayPal button
3. Redirected to PayPal for authentication
4. Returns to app with payment confirmation
5. Success handling identical to card payment

## Security Features
