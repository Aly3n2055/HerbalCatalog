# Performance Optimization Guide

## Current Performance Issues Addressed

### 1. Service Worker Registration
- **Issue**: SW registration failing in development with MIME type errors
- **Solution**: Only register service worker in production environment
- **Impact**: Eliminates console errors and improves development experience

### 2. Page Load Performance
- **Issue**: Slow page loads (>10 seconds reported)
- **Solution**: 
  - Added React.memo to Home and Products components
  - Implemented useMemo for expensive calculations
  - Optimized product sorting and filtering
- **Impact**: Reduced re-renders and improved rendering performance

### 3. Database Connection Optimization
- **Issue**: PostgreSQL connection timeouts and errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Added connection pooling configuration
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Added connection timeout settings
- **Impact**: More stable database connections

## Performance Monitoring

### Frontend Metrics
- Page load time tracking removed from production
- React DevTools Profiler for component analysis
- Network tab monitoring for API performance

### Backend Metrics
- Database query performance logging
- Connection pool monitoring
- API response time tracking

## Optimization Techniques Implemented

### 1. Component Memoization
```typescript
const ExpensiveComponent = memo(({ data }) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return data.map(item => processItem(item));
  }, [data]);
  
  return <div>{processedData}</div>;
});
```

### 2. Query Optimization
- Added retry logic to React Query
- Increased stale time for static data
- Implemented proper error boundaries

### 3. Bundle Optimization
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Code splitting for route-based chunks
- Tree shaking for unused dependencies

## Performance Targets

### Frontend
- Page load time: < 3 seconds
- Time to interactive: < 5 seconds
- First contentful paint: < 1.5 seconds

### Backend
- API response time: < 500ms
- Database query time: < 200ms
- Connection establishment: < 1 second

## Monitoring Tools

### Development
- React DevTools Profiler
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Network monitoring

### Production
- Web Vitals monitoring
- Error tracking with proper logging
- Performance metrics collection

## Next Steps

1. Implement virtual scrolling for large product lists
2. Add image optimization and lazy loading
3. Set up performance monitoring dashboard
4. Implement caching strategies for static content
